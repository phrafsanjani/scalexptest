We prove that there exists a pivotal quantity, as a function of a complete sufficient statistic, with a chi-square distribution. Using the similarity between equations of shortest, unbiased, and highest density CIs, all equations are reduced into a system of two equations that can be solved via a straightforward algorithm.},

The discussion assumes a background in advanced calculus, linear algebra, probability, and some analysis and topology. Measure theory is used, but the notation and basic results needed are presented in an initial chapter on probability, so prior knowledge of these topics is not essential. The presentation is designed to expose students to as many of the central ideas and topics in the discipline as possible, balancing various approaches to inference as well as exact, numerical, and large sample methods. Moving beyond more standard material, the book includes chapters introducing bootstrap methods, nonparametric regression, equivariant estimation, empirical Bayes, and sequential design and analysis. The book has a rich collection of exercises. Several of them illustrate how the theory developed in the book may be used in various applications. Solutions to many of the exercises are included in an appendix. Robert Keener is Professor of Statistics at the University of Michigan and a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics},

The selection of topics in this textbook is designed to provide students with a conceptual foundation that will facilitate a substantial understanding of statistical applications in these subjects. This new edition has been updated throughout and now also includes a downloadable Student Answer Manual containing detailed solutions to half of the over 300 end-of-chapter problems. After introducing the concepts of probability, random variables, and probability density functions, the author develops the key concepts of mathematical statistics, most notably: expectation, sampling, asymptotics, and the main families of distributions. The latter half of the book is then devoted to the theories of estimation and hypothesis testing with associated examples and problems that indicate their wide applicability in economics and business. Features of the new edition include: a reorganization of topic flow and presentation to facilitate reading and understanding; inclusion of additional topics of relevance to statistics and econometric applications; a more streamlined and simple-to-understand notation for multiple integration and multiple summation over general sets or vector arguments; updated examples; new end-of-chapter problems; a solution manual for students; a comprehensive answer manual for instructors; and a theorem and definition map. This book has evolved from numerous graduate courses in mathematical statistics and econometrics taught by the author, and will be ideal for students beginning graduate study as well as for advanced undergraduates},

	abstract = {In many statistical decision problems, the observations can be summarized in a single sufficient statistic such that the likelihood ratio for any two distributions in the family under consideration is a monotone function of that statistic. This paper assumes, accordingly, that the statistician's decision is to be based upon a single observation of a random variable \$X\$, whose distribution is given by (1) and satisfies the inequality (2) in Section 1. As examples of this family of distributions, we have the exponential family such as the normal, binomial, and Poisson. Other kinds of examples are given in Section 1. In connection with the ordinary testing problem, Allen [1] showed that for the composite testing problem of the one-sided type for the special case of the exponential family of distributions, an admissible minimax procedure must be of the form: choose action 1 (accept the hypothesis) if \$x {\textless} x\_0\$ and choose action 2 (accept the alternative) if \$x {\textgreater} x\_0\$. If \$x = x\_0\$, randomization may be required. Sobel [2] and Chernoff obtained partial results for the same class of distributions when the set of decisions is finite. This paper unifies, extends, and strengthens these results and treats of a wide variety of statistical decision problems for which the densities have a monotone likelihood ratio. In Section 1 the fundamental definition and preliminaries are introduced. In particular, the conditions imposed on the loss functions and the densities are delimited and some simple properties of these quantities are developed. In Section 2 we establish some of the basic lemmas. Noteworthy are Lemmas 1 and 2 which express the variation of sign diminishing properties of the densities which possess a monotone likelihood ratio. The essential completeness of the set of all monotone strategies (see Section 3 for the definition) in the class of all statistical procedures is demonstrated in Section 3 for the case of a finite number of actions. Section 4 deals with the problem of determining the form of all Bayes strategies for the statistician. The important problem of admissibility is studied in detail in Section 5. In the next section a study of the Bayes strategies for nature is made for the case of two actions. In Section 7 the complete class theory is carried through for the case of an infinite number of actions. This is accomplished by employing an argument involving a limiting procedure from the case of finite actions as treated in Section 3. The eighth section presents an analysis of the nature of the Bayes strategies for the case of an infinite number of actions. The final section entails a brief discussion of the connection of invariance theory and the conditions of monotonicity as are required throughout this paper. Further extensions of these ideas in a different direction, which involves relaxing the conditions on the loss functions and strengthening the requirements on the densities, can be found in [3].},

Let \$({\textbackslash}theta\_1, {\textbackslash}eta\_2)\$ be the mixed parameters, where \${\textbackslash}eta\_2 = E{\textbackslash}\{u\_2(X){\textbackslash}\}\$.

It is shown that if \$u\_2(x)\$ is a 1-1 function then the random variables \$T\_2\$ and \$Z\_n = T\_1 - n{\textbackslash}varphi(T\_2/n)\$ are independent and that the statistic \$Z\_n\$ is ancillary for \${\textbackslash}theta\_2\$ in the presence of \${\textbackslash}theta\_1\$ (i.e. the density of \$Z\_n\$ depends on \${\textbackslash}theta\_1\$ only). Furthermore, the density of \$Z\_n\$ belongs to the one-parameter exponential family with natural parameter \${\textbackslash}theta\_1\$.
